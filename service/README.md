### Overview of the Wallet System:

The Wallet System is a digital platform dedicated to managing financial transactions and maintaining a record of
balances for individual wallets. At its core, it's designed to emulate the fundamental operations of a traditional
physical wallet, but in a digital realm, enabling users to perform credits and debits, monitor their balances, and
review their transaction history.

Its primary objective is to provide a robust, efficient, and transparent mechanism for digital financial management. By
harnessing an append-only, event-sourced model, the system ensures an immutable transaction history, guaranteeing the
integrity and reliability of each transaction. This not only elevates security but also provides a clear and
comprehensive audit trail, vital for both individual users and potential oversight entities.

Serving as a foundational layer in the digital financial ecosystem, this Wallet System can be the cornerstone for a
plethora of applications, ranging from personal finance tools to expansive e-commerce platforms. Its design philosophy
emphasizes simplicity in its core functions, ensuring that the fundamental tasks it performs are done with unparalleled
efficiency and accuracy.

### Wallet System Architecture:

#### Core Components:

1. **Wallet Table**:
    - Represents individual wallets.
    - Each wallet has a unique and immutable ID.

2. **Transaction Table**:
    - Captures every transaction made against a wallet.
    - Attributes: associated wallet ID, transaction type (credit/debit), amount, timestamp, and a reference to the
      transaction group, if applicable.

3. **Transaction Snapshot Table**:
    - Stores periodic snapshots of transactions.
    - Includes a special ledger entry to represent the cumulative balance, ensuring efficient balance lookups.

4. **Transaction Archive Table**:
    - Used for archiving older transactions, ensuring the main transaction table remains performant.
    - No foreign key constraints to ensure data remains static once archived.

#### Approach:

- **Event-Sourced Model**: Every change to the state of a wallet is captured as an immutable event (transaction) in the
  system. This provides a reliable and consistent mechanism to replay or reconstruct the state of a wallet at any point
  in time.

- **Append-Only**: Transactions are never updated or deleted. Every action, whether it's a credit or debit, is always
  appended as a new transaction.

#### Benefits:

1. **Immutability**: A historical and unalterable record of all transactions ensures a transparent audit trail.

2. **Concurrency**: The system supports concurrent transaction insertions, eliminating the need for locks on a mutable
   balance field, and thereby enhancing performance.

3. **Consistency and Audit Trail**: An append-only system provides a built-in and clear audit trail. Since every change
   is an event, it provides full visibility into the lifecycle of a wallet.

#### Caveats and Solutions:

1. **Performance**:
    - Summing transactions can slow down as data grows. Periodic balance snapshots or ledger entries in the transaction
      snapshot table help in speeding up balance calculations.
    - Archiving mechanism moves older transactions to an archive table, maintaining the performance of the main
      transaction table.

2. **Ordering**:
    - Relying solely on timestamps may not always be adequate due to potential clock skew in distributed systems. Using
      sequence numbers or other ordering mechanisms can counteract this.

3. **Data Volume**:
    - Given the append-only nature, data will accumulate over time. The archiving strategy helps in managing older data
      without compromising on the system's integrity.

By embracing an append-only, event-sourced approach, the wallet system is poised to offer robustness, traceability, and
scalability.

### Extensibility and Modular Design:

While the foundational architecture of the wallet system is tailored to ensure simplicity, reliability, and efficiency
in its core functionality, it's inherently designed with extensibility in mind. Features like transaction thresholds,
advanced analytical processing using OLAP, and more can seamlessly be integrated atop the current implementation.

The project's ethos underscores the importance of a lean core, prioritizing impeccable performance in foundational
tasks. By keeping the base implementation uncluttered, we not only ensure robustness but also maintain the flexibility
to evolve and expand as per future requirements. This modular approach aids in quicker iterations, easier debugging, and
provides a solid ground for future innovations without entangling complexities.

### Externalized Operations: Daily Snapshots and Archiving

Our wallet system is designed with modularity in mind. It offers built-in functionalities for creating daily snapshots
and archiving older transactions, ensuring efficient performance and data compactness even as transaction volume grows.

However, the mechanism to invoke these operations has been externalized, keeping the system's core design uncluttered.
This design decision was taken with adaptability in focus. Different solutions or applications that integrate with our
wallet system might have varying operational patterns, infrastructure setups, or preferences for when and how often
these operations should be triggered.

The functionalities for daily snapshots and archiving are housed within the `TransactionSnapshotService` class.
Specifically, the methods responsible are:

- `captureDailySnapshot(Integer walletId)`: Creates a snapshot of transactions for the specified wallet.
- `archiveOldSnapshots(Integer walletId, LocalDateTime olderThan)`: Archives transactions older than a specified date
  for the given wallet and provides ledger entries for streamlined balance computation.

Setting up the invocation of these methods should be managed externally, based on the specific requirements and
operational dynamics of the solution leveraging this wallet system. It allows for a high degree of customization,
whether one wants to use CRON jobs, event-driven triggers, manual interventions, or any other scheduling mechanisms.

By allowing the integration layer or the parent solution to control these operations, we ensure that the wallet system
remains both versatile and adaptable to diverse usage scenarios.

### Externalized Operations: Complex Funds Transfer

In the realm of financial applications, there are multifaceted scenarios where the need arises to transfer funds across
three or more wallets. Such operations might not just involve the mere movement of money but may also encompass
intricate business rules, verification thresholds, and intensive security checks.

#### Limitation in the Wallet System

Our Wallet System is designed with a modular and extensible philosophy, focusing on core functionalities. Thus, it
deliberately excludes built-in functions for transferring funds between three or more wallets. The primary reason for
this exclusion is the high variability and complexity of multi-wallet transfers that often require bespoke solutions
tailored to the specific needs of each project.

#### Building Your Custom Complex Funds Transfer

Creating a complex funds transfer feature atop the Wallet System is feasible and can be streamlined by leveraging the
existing functionalities.

1. **Starting Point**: The `TransactionService.transferBetweenTwoWallets` method provides a foundational example. It
   illustrates the key components required for any funds transfer, namely:
    - Validating wallets.
    - Holding and reserving funds.
    - Confirming or rejecting the transactions.

   This method can serve as an archetype when designing more sophisticated multi-wallet transfers.

2. **Transaction Group Management**: When dealing with a collection of transactions as part of a single logical
   operation, it's essential to use the `TransactionGroup` entity.
    - Every group of transactions should belong to one unique `TransactionGroup`.
    - The status of the `TransactionGroup` should mirror the state of its associated transactions. For instance, if all
      transactions are successful, the group's status should be set to `CONFIRMED`.

3. **Error Handling & Rollback**: Multi-wallet transfers inherently have multiple points of failure. It's crucial to:
    - Capture and log all errors.
    - Rollback any interim transactions that might have been processed before an error occurred. The `REJECTED` status
      can be used to invalidate a previously held or reserved transaction.
    - Ensure that the status of the `TransactionGroup` accurately reflects the outcome â€“ especially in cases of partial
      success or failure.

4. **Security & Verification**: Given that complex transfers might necessitate additional verification and security
   checks:
    - Implement multi-factor authentication or OTPs where required.
    - Ensure all transaction requests are validated against predefined thresholds.
    - Employ rigorous auditing to track every transaction change, especially in high-value transfers.
